# YouTube Clone App

Welcome to the **YouTube Clone App**! This project is my first step into iOS app development using Swift. Itâ€™s a simple YouTube clone that fetches data from the official YouTube API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. I'm currently learning Swift and SwiftUI to enhance my skills and get comfortable with these tools.

## Project Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Swift:** The native language for iOS development.
- **SwiftUI and UIKit:** Used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

### API Integration
- Fetching video data, metadata, and other information from the official YouTube API.

## Features

1. **Home Screen**  
   Displays a list of videos fetched from the YouTube API.

2. **Video Screen**  
   Simulates a video player interface.

3. **Scroll Feature**  
   Smooth scrolling through a list of videos.
